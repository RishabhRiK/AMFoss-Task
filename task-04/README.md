Movie Data ETL and Dashboard Project

This project provides a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing movie data. It reads data from a CSV file, cleans and transforms it using Python, loads it into a MySQL database, and visualizes the results in an interactive web-based dashboard.

 Features

    Data Extraction: Reads movie data from a movies.csv source file.

    Data Transformation: Cleans data, handles missing values, and extracts structured information (like genre and country) using Python's Pandas library.

    Data Loading: Initializes a MySQL database and loads the cleaned data into a structured movies table.

    Interactive Dashboard: A web-based dashboard (likely using a framework like Dash or Streamlit) to visualize key insights from the movie data.

 Installation

To get this project up and running, follow these steps.

    Clone the Repository
    Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

Set up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.
Bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set up MySQL

        Make sure you have a MySQL server installed and running.

        Update the database connection details (username, password, host) in the conecshon.py and mysql_init.py files to match your local setup.

Usage

Follow these steps to run the complete pipeline.

    Initialize the Database
    Run the mysql_init.py script to create the database and the necessary tables. This only needs to be done once.
    Bash

python mysql_init.py

Run the Main ETL Pipeline
Execute the main.py script to extract, transform, and load the data from movies.csv into your MySQL database.
Bash

python main.py

This will also generate a movies_output.csv file with the cleaned data.

Launch the Dashboard
Start the interactive dashboard to view the data visualizations.
Bash

    python dashboard.py

    Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050).

 File Descriptions

    main.py: The core ETL script. It reads movies.csv, processes the data, saves the cleaned data to movies_output.csv, and loads it into the MySQL database.

    dashboard.py: The script to launch the web-based interactive dashboard for data visualization.

    mysql_init.py: A one-time setup script to create the MySQL database and the movies table schema.

    conecshon.py: A helper module that contains the database connection configuration details used by other scripts.

    movies.csv: The raw, unprocessed input dataset containing movie information.

    movies_output.csv: The cleaned and processed data file generated by main.py.

    requirements.txt: A list of all Python libraries required to run the project (e.g., pandas, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python).

    trial.py: A script likely used for testing, experimentation, or developing specific functionalities.
